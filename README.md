# Snowflakes Theme

This app adds some snowflakes to the web UI of your Nextcloud server.

Currently, this is very early stage and no configuration is possible.
There is the plan to enhance this further but this will need some development work.

For issues and questions, contact me via the [issues of this repository on Github](https://github.com/christianlupus-nextcloud/snowflakestheme/issues).
